# JNet development state

This release comes with some ready made classes:

* JNet:
    * Few basic classes used in other projects like [KNet](https://github.com/masesgroup/KNet). If something is not available use [API extensibility](API_extensibility.md) to cover missing classes.
* JNetCLI: no functions at this moment
* JNetReflector: builds the skeleton of the class
